- properly sanitize fields without clobbering all special characters
- change months validation to > 0 instead of > 1. people can have less than 1 month of experience! (though maybe it doesn't make sense to feel like an impostor at that point...?)
- add created_at to post show
- optimize index queries (everything loads)
