# Impostor Roster

Contributions are very much welcome! I typically do a better job at making projects friendly to contributors, but this one sort of came out of nowhere. For now, here's a non-exhaustive list of stuff I'd like to do:

## Todo

- Pagination or some kind of separation of topics or something. Not too much though. I sort of like it being a big weird list. Perhaps infinite scroll.
- Allow users to enter Days, Months, Years or any combination in the form; display the same intelligently on the view.
- Category auto-complete from existing categories in form
- Search
- Some kind of "Me Too!" button for posts that registers your own ineptitude for the same topic. Perhaps add your own length of experience and somehow show this (maybe as a total of all 'me toos' years of experience for the topic.). Would have to have a rough way to prevent spamming this.
- Profanity filter?
- Inappropriateness flagging?
- Non-bootstrap styling!
- Go through and get everything closer to Rails conventions (including things like partials, etc.)
- Upgrade to Rails 5
- More robust hosting situation
- DB backups
